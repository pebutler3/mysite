This is my personal website.

I recently rebuilt my site using Bourbon + Neat and glad I did. 

Previously it was built with Foundation (which I still love), but was complete over kill on a site with no real color or pictures... or anything really!

With that said, I am happy to report that my CSS file went from more than 70kb down to less than 5 and no JS needed. Boom.
